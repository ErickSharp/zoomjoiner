Open-source application that automatically joins Zoom calls.

QUARTZ IS NEEDED. You must install Quartz and included it in the referenced libraries.

This works best when you are just able to walk away from the computer and leave the program to do its thing. It isn't set up to be able to multitask, and uses ALT+F4 at the leave times to close out the meetings, which could be bad if you are doing work and it closes out your program if thats what is currently focused.
